Omnet++ ring topology simulated network 

This is for a university practical. It simulated a ring topology network with 4 connected devices. 
The devices can only communicate with their neighbor, thus if device 1 wants to communicate with device 4 the message has
to be forwarded from 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and finally 3 to 4. 

The network simulated communication delays, as well as dropped/lost messages.
